            <ul class="list-group-flush">
              <li class="list-group-item">1. It’s critical to start with the right type of meat. Don’t skimp on the fat. Look for a mix of 80-percent lean beef and 20-percent fat for a juicier, more flavorful burger. Although ground chuck is standard, you can also opt for flavorful ground brisket or ground short ribs. Season with salt and pepper, but use a gentle touch, as over-mixing or compacting the ground meat will result in dense, firm burgers.</li>
              <li class="list-group-item">2. Sear the burgers directly over the coals until brown and crispy on the bottom, about four to five minutes. You’ll know to flip the patties when you see liquid pooling on the uncooked surface. Be careful not to char the meat or press down on the patties with a spatula while cooking, you’ll squeeze out all those flavorful juices. Flare-ups will happen. This is just the fat rendering and dripping onto the coals. Simply move the burgers to the other side of the grate until the flames subside. Use a long-handled metal spatula to flip the burgers only once. Then sear the other side to lock in the juices.</li>
              <li class="list-group-item">3. Once the burgers are seared, reposition the burgers so that they are no longer directly over the coals, place the lid atop the BBQ and continue cooking until they reach the desired temperature. It’s always a good idea to use a meat thermometer to confirm doneness.</li>
              <li class="list-group-item">4. As the burgers approach completion, now is the time to add cheese, if desired. You want to give it enough time to achieve melty goodness, so plan ahead. And don’t forget to butter and toast those burger buns. Watch them closely — they burn fast.</li>
              <li class="list-group-item">5. There is no need to “rest” a burger. Put it right on those toasted buns, add the toppings you like best and enjoy</li>
